# Garage

Hi there, it's me again! This Java program is about managing a sort of garage with 3 types of vehicles (cars, motorbikes and vans).

Its main functions are:
- adding a vehicle to the garage slot
- taking a vehicle from a garage slot
- printing various info about the state of the garage and the vehicles

Enjoy!
